# Roadmap Generation

Please take the [design document](../../docs/design-document.md) and the [architecture document](../../docs/architecture-document.md) and create an extensive roadmap for the project. 

Please go into detail, but add no implementation in the document. The roadmap should include:

- **Phases**: Clear project phases with objectives
- **Timeline**: Realistic time estimates for each phase
- **Dependencies**: Critical dependencies between phases and tasks
- **Milestones**: Key deliverables and decision points
- **Resource Requirements**: Skills and resources needed for each phase

Save it in `docs/roadmap.md`.
